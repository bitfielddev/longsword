# 2.3.0
## Scope Shake
A new feature has been added which makes shaking scopes possible. This allows for realistic effects, like inexperienced operators not able to keep the gun steady. This can be controlled using a hook LSCalculateShakeIntensity/LSCalculateShakeFrequency(Weapon) that returns a multiplier.
